// index.html variant). Playground-specific assets (vendor JS/CSS, KaTeX fonts,
// playground.js, playground.css, pg-i18n.js) are NOT in this FS; they live in
// web/playground/static-pg and are only embedded when the `playground` build tag
// is set. See web/playground/embed_playground.go and embed_playground_stub.go.
//
// The Playground runtime toggle is controlled by Config.EnablePlayground in
// config.yaml; even with the `playground` build tag the user can disable the
// feature at runtime to serve index-nopg.html.
